# EH2745-Assignment-2-Jorge-Ballesteros-
In this assignment we want to implement machine learning and the power system modeling techniques in order to create a system that can predict depending on the values of the nominal voltages and angles at the buses if we have a high load, low load, generator disconnected or line disconnected. In this way we can recognize much faster after running our load flow calculations in which situation our system is.

The first step in this code is to generate the system, which is comprised of:
- 9 Buses
  - 2 Generator Buses
  - 6 Load Buses
  - 1 Slack Bus
 - Lines of 10 km length each
